# StudentLab

StudentLab is a student CRM app built for JumpstartLab. You can keep track of the interactions that your instructors have with your students, and easily create one-on-one sessions, assessments and evaluations.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run bundle install
3. Run rake db:create
3. Create /config/application.yml and put your Github keys there.

StudentLab runs on MongoDB, so you won't need to migrate anything.
